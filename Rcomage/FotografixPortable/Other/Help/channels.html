<h1>Working with channels</h1>

<p>Fotografix uses the <em>RGB colour model</em> in which images are formed by mixing three basic colours - red, green and blue - in varying proportions. These three colours give rise to three <em>colour channels</em>, with each channel containing a portion of the image corresponding to that specific colour.</p>
<p>While most of the time you will view the image normally, certain situations call for inspecting/modifying individual channels. The <em>channel selector</em> right below the <em>layers palette</em> allows you to view and modify the image in different channel combinations. The default, <strong>RGB</strong>, displays the image normally (in all three channels) while the others display either one or two channels at a time. The <strong>Mask</strong> channel is not a colour channel, but is used in conjunction with layer masks. (for more information, see <a href="layer_masks.html">Using layer masks</a>)</p>
