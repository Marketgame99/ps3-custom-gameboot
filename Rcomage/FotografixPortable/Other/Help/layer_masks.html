<h1>Using layer masks</h1>

<p><em>Layer masks</em> are used to partially hide the contents of a layer. The hidden portions are still present in the image, but not visible; these portions are said to be <em>masked</em>.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with layer masks</h2>
<ul>
<li>To add a mask to an existing layer, choose <strong>Layer &gt; Add Layer Mask</strong>. If a selection exists while adding the mask, that portion of the layer will be made visible and the rest will be hidden.</li>
<li>To choose a layer mask for painting and other operations, choose <strong>Mask</strong> in the channel selector. To return to the layer, choose <strong>RGB</strong>. For more information, see <a href="channels.html">Working with channels</a>.</li>
<li>Painting on the layer mask reveals/hides portions of the layer; painting with white reveals, painting with black hides and painting with other shades of gray partially reveals.</li>
</ul>
