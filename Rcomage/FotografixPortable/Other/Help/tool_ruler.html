<h1>Using the Ruler tool</h1>

<p>The Ruler tool is used to measure the distance/angle between two points on an image.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Ruler tool by clicking on its icon in the tool box or by pressing <strong>L</strong>.</li>
<li>Click and drag on the canvas to draw a line whose length and angle will be computed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result of each ruler operation opens in a new mini-window. You can give a name to each window to help identify it.</p>
