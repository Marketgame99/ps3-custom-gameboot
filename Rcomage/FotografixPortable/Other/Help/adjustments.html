<h1>Enhancing images</h1>

<p>Fotografix provides a number of methods to digitally enhance photos and other images. These enhancements fall into two major categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic <em>adjustments</em> such as brightness and contrast adjustment, available under the <strong>Adjustments</strong> menu</li>
<li>Special effect <em>filters</em> such as motion blur, available under the <strong>Filter</strong> menu</li>
</ol>

<p>All adjustments and filters apply only to the active layer. If your image contains multiple layers, first choose the layer that you would like to modify. Adjustments and filters can be further restricted to a portion of the image by selecting that portion first.</p>

<h2>Using adjustment layers</h2>
<p>An <em>adjustment layer</em> is a special type of layer that applies an adjustment to all layers below it. Unlike a regular adjustment, an adjustment layer does not modify the underlying image itself; instead the adjustment is dynamically applied to the underlying layers. In this way, you can try various adjustments without losing the original image.</p>
<p>To create an adjustment layer, choose one of the adjustments under the <strong>Layer &gt; New Adjustment Layer</strong> menu. You can edit the adjustment at any time by using the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> command. For more information, see <a href="layers.html">Working with layers</a>.</p>
<p>If you select a portion of the image before creating an adjustment layer, the adjustment will be applied only to that portion. You can also include/exclude portions later by painting on the adjustment layer.</p>
