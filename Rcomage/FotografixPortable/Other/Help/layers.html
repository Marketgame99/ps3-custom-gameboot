<h1>Working with layers</h1>

<p>Layers are analogous to semi-transparent sheets of paper stacked one above the other. Each layer can be edited independently of the others and the resultant image is the composition of all these layers. Layers allow for <em>non-destructive editing</em> by allowing you to edit one portion of an image without disturbing the others.</p>

<h2>Using the layers palette</h2>

<p>The <em>layers palette</em> on the right hand side of the Fotografix window lists all the layers in the current image. It also displays additional information about each layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A check-mark at the left indicates that the layer is currently visible.</li>
<li>The icon to the left of the layer name indicates the type of layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can perform several actions on layers using the layers palette:</p>
<ul>
<li>To show/hide a layer, click the check-box at the left of the layer's name.</li>
<li>To modify layer properties, double-click the layer's name or right-click the name and choose <strong>Layer Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>To change the position of a layer in the image, drag and drop its name at the new position. Alternatively, you can right-click its name and choose <strong>Move Up</strong> or <strong>Move Down</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Layer properties</h2>
<p>Each layer has two main properties, modifiable through the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> menu command:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <em>opacity</em> value expressed as a percentage that determines how opaque the layer is. A value of 0 corresponds to fully transparent (invisible) and a value of 100 corresponds to fully opaque; intermediate values make the layer semi-transparent.</li>
<li>A <em>blending mode</em> that determines how the colours in the layer mix with those below. Modes apart from Normal can be useful in fixing photos as well as for creating special effects.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for working with layers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most operations in Fotografix (all tools, adjustments and filters) modify only the active layer. (the one which is selected in the layers palette)</li>
<li>All new images start with a single layer. You can add more layers choosing <strong>Layer &gt; New &gt; Layer</strong> from the menu or by pressing <strong>Ctrl+Shift+N</strong>.</li>
<li>A layer can be moved around the canvas using the <a href="tool_move.html">Move tool</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Layers and file formats</h2>
<p>Not all image file formats support layers. When you open an existing image whose format does not support layers, the entire image will be contained in a single layer. You can add new layers to an image, but these layers will be preserved only if saved in Fotografix format. For more information, see <a href="file_formats.html">Supported file formats</a>.</p>
